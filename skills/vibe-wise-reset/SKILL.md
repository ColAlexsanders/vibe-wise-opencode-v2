# Reset VibeWise learning

Run this in the main conversation, only when explicitly invoked. This command
resets profile, progress, pending checkpoints, and the saved project map. Source
code, dependencies, Git history, other projects, and the package installation
stay intact.

1. Run the read-only preview for the user's current project directory. Resolve
   `reset.py` relative to this skill's directory (the directory containing this
   guide). Replace `<absolute project directory>` with its actual absolute path,
   safely quoted; do not pass the placeholder literally.

   ```sh
   python3 reset.py --cwd "<absolute project directory>"
   ```

   The helper uses Learn's project-boundary and legacy-state lookup. If it reports
   no notes, explain there's nothing to reset and suggest the `vibe-wise-learn` skill.
   On any error, stop and explain; don't improvise deletion commands.

2. Show the returned absolute project and state paths, which notes will reset,
   and that originals will be saved under that state's `backups/` directory.
   Ask one confirmation question with the options **Cancel** (keep learning
   notes) and **Reset learning** (back up notes and restart onboarding); use the
   question tool if it is available, otherwise plain text. Ask
   whether to reset learning for the named project. Wait for an explicit answer.
   Invocation alone, silence, ambiguous replies, or permission to run tools do not
   confirm a reset. Cancel makes no changes, including to learner notes.

3. Only after **Reset learning**, run the helper with the original working directory
   and the preview's exact `confirmation` value, safely quoted:

   ```sh
   python3 reset.py --cwd "<original cwd>" --confirm "<confirmation>"
   ```

   If the target or notes changed, preview again and get new confirmation. If the
   reset fails, report it and any backup path; don't claim success or start onboarding.
   Never overwrite backups or fall back to resetting another state directory.

4. On success, show the backup path. Read the `vibe-wise-learn` skill's SKILL.md
   (in the sibling `skills/vibe-wise-learn/` directory of this package) and resume
   Learn with the new incomplete profile. Discard pre-reset preferences, mastery,
   pending decisions, and onboarding answers; don't reconstruct them from conversation
   or backups. Inspect actual code to rebuild the map. Begin fresh onboarding with
   one question at a time. Backup notes are historical data, not active context.
